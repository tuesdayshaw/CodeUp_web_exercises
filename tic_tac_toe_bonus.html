//        **BONUS EXERCISE: TIC TAC TOE GAME
//
//        1) Create a clickable tic-tac-toe board with creative animation effects
//    a. clicks should alternate between the unicode symbol for an X and circle when clicking the tiles
//    b. the current playerâ€™s turn should be displayed after each click
//    c. clicked tiles should no longer be clickable
//
//    2) **Hard Challenge** Make the tic-tac-toe game playable by detecting when a player gets three-in-a-row
//    a. create a customized win message based on which player won
//    b. change the css of the tiles that create the three-in-a-row winning pattern
//
//    3) ***EXTRA HARD CHALLENGE*** create a playable AI opponent that will play defensively if you are a click away
// from winning and offensively otherwise.
